            <h2>Here's What Keeps Me Up at Night...</h2>
            <p>You've just spent weeks helping a student break through their limiting beliefs. They're finally confident, motivated, ready to take on the world.</p>
            
            <p>Then they go back to school.</p>
            
            <p>Same environment. Same peer group. Same teachers who still see them as the "same" kid they used to be.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Within 30 days, 78% of your transformation work gets erased by their unchanged environment.</strong></p>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>What if there was a way to embed your breakthrough students into a peer community that reinforces everything you've taught them?</h3>
            <p>What if instead of being the only confident, growth-minded teen in their school, they became the leader of 30-50 other teens on the same transformation journey?</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Missing Link in Teen Transformation</h2>
            <p>You know the problem as well as I do. Individual coaching works brilliantly in isolation. But real, lasting change happens when that student becomes part of a community that shares their new values.</p>
            
            <p>That's exactly what COE does.</p>
            
            <p>We take your breakthrough students and give them a leadership platform where they can:</p>
            
            <ul class="bullet-list">
                <li>Lead 30-50 peers through the same transformation methodology you use</li>
                <li>Practice their new confidence in a safe, supportive environment</li>
                <li>Build unshakeable self-worth by helping others overcome the same challenges</li>
                <li>Create lasting friendships with other growth-minded teens</li>
                <li>Develop real leadership skills through managing actual responsibility</li>

            <h2>Why Hinksey Labs + COE = Unstoppable</h2>
            <p>You specialize in the individual breakthrough. We specialize in the community that makes it permanent.</p>
            
            <p>Your student arrives to our COE calls already equipped with the mindset tools you've given them. Instead of struggling with self-doubt like most teens, they step immediately into leadership.</p>
            
            <p>They become living proof that transformation is possible. Other teens see them and think: "If they can do it, maybe I can too."</p>
            
            <p><strong>Your one breakthrough student becomes the catalyst for 50 more transformations.</strong></p>
        </div>

        <div class="social-proof">
            "I thought my confidence would disappear when I went back to school. Instead, leading the COE club made me even stronger. Now other kids come to ME for advice. It's like my coaching sessions never ended - they just multiplied."

            <h2>The Partnership Opportunity</h2>
            <p>We're launching our first UK pilot cohort on October 1st. Completely free. Four spots remain.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't about us recruiting your students. This is about creating a bridge between your individual work and lasting community change.</p>
            
            <p>Your breakthrough students need a place to practice their new identity. Our cohorts need natural leaders who've already done the inner work.</p>
            
            <p>Perfect match.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3>What This Means for Your Students</h3>
            <p>They don't just maintain their confidence - they multiply it by teaching others. They don't just overcome their challenges - they become the person other teens turn to for guidance. They don't just transform their own life - they transform their entire school culture.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scarcity">
            <strong>Only 4 spots remain for our October 1st UK pilot cohort.</strong><br>
            This is the only free cohort we'll run in the UK. Future cohorts will require full investment.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Simple Next Step</h2>
            <p>If you have a student who's made significant breakthroughs in confidence, leadership potential, or overcoming limiting beliefs - and you want to see that transformation become permanent while they impact dozens of other teens - this partnership could be exactly what they need.</p>
            
            <p>No complex application process. No lengthy commitments. Just a conversation about whether your student would thrive in the upcoming cohort.</p>
